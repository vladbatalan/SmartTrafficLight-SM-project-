Information about the project

At least once a week there’s a traffic accident involving an emergency service vehicle, such as a fire engine or an ambulance. 
Especially at intersections, it is a scare every time you have to slow down in front of the green traffic light because a car with a siren and blue flashing light is approaching.  
Traffic light control systems are widely used to monitor and control the flow of automobiles through the junction of many roads. 
They aim to realize smooth motion of cars in the transportation routes.

Inductive-loop traffic detectors use an electrically conducting loop embedded in the pavement to send a signal to the traffic control system to indicate the presence of a vehicle.
Inductive-loop sensors are, by far, the most common type of sensors used in traffic control signals. 
Our project is based on this concept, that gives different traffic lights depending on the realtime road conditions using data from sensors.

The sensor is essential because it measures the speed at which a vehicle approaches. 
It retains the distance from the traffic light between 2 times measured at a certain well-defined time interval. 
If the program considers that the vehicle is approaching very fast, it will change the light of the traffic light to red. 

All this data will be sent to a database and will also be accessible on the application site in real time.

This project was successfully carried out by Batalan Vlad, Pașcu Alexandru, Mircea Mihai and Cîrstea Cătălin, all students at Automation and Computers, CTI 1308A.
